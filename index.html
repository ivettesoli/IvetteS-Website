	<h1>Ivette Soliver</h1>
	<h2>Home Life:</h2>
	<p>To begin with, I live with both my parents and my brother. Our family is full of love and passion for one another and never has it changed. We like to listen to music, order food, and enjoy quality time together on the weekends.</p>
	 <h2>About Me:</h2>
     <p>I'm a Dominican 17 year old female born and raised in the Bronx,NY. I enjoy being in my room and listening to music in peace. I am an ambivert. At times I want to be outside and sometimes I want to be home, it all depends. My favorite place to eat at is Chipotle, you can never go wrong with Chipotle. I have one sibling, and that is my 25 year old brother who is the light of my life.<p>
     <h2>Letter to my Future Self:</h2>
     <p>I hope you're living in that mansion you promised yourself to get. I hope that you have that Range Rover and Mercedes that you always dreamed of. I hope that you got everything you asked for and manifested into your life, because you didn't go through all this for nothing. You workd your butt off every single day to be in the position you are in now. Keep going, grind doesn't have a limit. Your family, friends, and loved ones are supporting you. You got this. I am proud of you. I love you.<p>
